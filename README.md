# -Python-classification-model

A large bank has asked us to evaluate the marketing algorithms they use for retail banking. Their sophisticated phone marketing algorithm predicts whether a certain person will subscribe to a term deposit or not. Based on that assessment, the bank then optimises its phone calling strategy. With this algorithm, the bank has been successful in predicting which clients are more likely to subscribe to their term deposits. 

Management is now interested in finding out how a classification model can lead to certain decision-making processes. 

i Create a classification model in Python.  using  SkLearn libraries ,  
i Analysed the model and provide insight into which features/variables influence the outcome of the classification the most: on a global level, and specifically for observation #4 and #20.
i Developed some  plot  with brief comments on your observations.
